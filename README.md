# JSM2023: Programming for Data Science

## Abstract

Data science has evolved significantly in the past decade, with the convergence of computer science and statistics. As statisticians, we are trained to understand data using statistical and mathematical models. However, data scientists can spend up to 80% of their time pulling, organizing, and cleaning data, which requires a basic understanding of databases. Furthermore, machine learning positions are increasingly focused on software engineering rather than math and theory. Many data science interviews include questions about algorithms, data structures, and databases, which are not typically covered in a statistics curriculum.

This course will cover how data science has evolved in the past decade, how working in the industry differs from academia, and the data science interview process. Additionally, the course will cover engineering aspects and teach the programming fundamentals necessary for a career in data science, which are often tested in data science and machine learning interviews. The course will use SQL and Python.

## Outline

### Introduction: data science in practice (1 hour)

In this section, we will discuss the changes in data science in the past ten years. We will also introduce data science as a career (interview and career path) and how it differs from academia.
- Changes in data science change in the past ten years
- Data science in tech 
- Industry v.s. Academia
- Data science career path
- Data science interview process

### Database and data modeling (1 hour)

In this section, we will introduce the fundamentals of database and data modeling. Participants will learn how data move from different data sources to Datalake and then Datamart. 
- Why do we need to learn this?
- Big data environment
- Data modeling and pipeline

### Data structures / Algorithms (1 hour)

This section will focus on some basic data structures and some common algorithm problems that will take advantage of these data structures.
- Why do we need to learn data structure?
- Time-space complexity
- Data Structures for interviews
- Array lists, linked lists
- Hash tables
- Heaps
- Trees / graphs

### Hands-on tech setup (30 mins)

In this section, we will set up the cloud environment, load the data needed, and teach participants how to use the notebooks.

### Algorithms hands-on (1.5 hours)

In this section, we will do some common programming practice problems of easy to medium difficulty.  We will explain tips and tricks as well as an explanation of the solution.
- Practice programming problems

### SQL in a nutshell (1 hour)

In this section, we will introduce the 20% SQL that covers 80% of the usage.
- Learn SQL fundamentals such as Joins, Aggregations, and Subqueries. 

### SQL hands-on (1 hour)

In this section, we will show how to use SQL to query real data to answer a data science question. Participants will learn how to do a data science project from the beginning to the end after this section. 

## Learning outcomes
After taking the CE course, participants will learn the programming fundamentals required for a career in data science and often seen in data science/machine learning interviews. By the end of the program, you will have a basic understanding of databases, SQL, and data structure

- Understand the change in data science in the past ten years
- Understand data science in tech industries and how it is different from academia
- Learn the career path of data science to make better-informed career decisions
- Participants who are looking for a data science position will find it helpful to learn the data science interview process and coding interview expectations 
- Participants will have a foundational understanding of databases and SQL that covers 80% of the use case
- Understanding of basic data structures

## Content and instructional methods

- Instructors will guide the participants to create a free Databricks community edition. It will open the door to big data cloud environments, which include R, Python, SQL, and Spark. Data sets related to real-world problems will be provided.
- Instructors will take a brief survey on essential data science skills and knowledge. Participants will understand the gap between their background and the need for a data scientist.
- Instructors will go through the course material highlighted in the outline. All the data sets in the course are available, and the code is repeatable. The participants will be able to practice themselves.
- Instructors will explain the theory and guide participants through the corresponding coding exercises. They will learn better by doing.
- Instructors will suggest further reading and training on the listed topics in the outline section.
